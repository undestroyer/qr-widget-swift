#  Changelog

# 1.0.0 (5) - Added functionality

Apple rejected 1.0.0 (4) with comment:

> We noticed that your app includes an AR or QR scanner but does not include any additional content or functionality unless the user has access to the AR marker or QR code. While we understand that your app displays additional content when an AR marker or QR code is scanned, to users who do not have access to the AR markers or QR codes, your app only appears to display a camera view.

In this build new functionality was added:

+ Add: Scanning QR from gallery photos
+ Add: Generating QR manually

# 1.0.0 (4) - Privacy settins fix

+ Fix: Camera usage description
+ Add: InfoPlist.strings to localize plist keys

## 1.0.0 - First release

+ Added: QR scanner
+ Added: QR preview (home screen)
+ Added: About screen
+ Added: Widget
